# Manual inspection
Manual assessment of the machine translations aimed at specifically identifying issues with potential impact on bag-of-word analyses. Therefore we did not focus on style or syntaxic issues in the translated texts but sought issues at word level. In particular, we identified in sample texts: 
1. Anomalies present both in the original text and in the translation (likely due to OCR and encoding issues, such as those identified in the previous section); 
2. Anomalies introduced by the translation while not present in the original text;
3. Anomalies present in the original text but corrected through machine-translation.
