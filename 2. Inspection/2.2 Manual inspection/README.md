# Manual inspection
Manual assessment of the machine translations aimed at specifically identifying issues with potential impact on bag-of-word analyses. Therefore we did not focus on style or syntaxic issues in the translated texts but sought issues at word level. In particular, we identified in sample texts: (i) anomalies present both in the original text and in the translation (likely due to OCR and encoding issues, such as those identified in the previous section); (ii) anomalies introduced by the translation while not present in the original text, (iii) anomalies present in the original text but corrected through machine-translation.
