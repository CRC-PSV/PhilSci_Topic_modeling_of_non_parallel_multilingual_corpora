# Preprocessing
For preprocessing, we followed the same methodological steps as in (Malaterre et al. 2020). As a preliminary step, we assembled the sub-corpus of English articles together with the non-Endlish articles. We then preprocessed the data wich include: 
- removing terms such as determinants, prepositions or pronouns with part-of-speech (POS) tagging;
- lemmatizing the textual data in order to reduce the number of word variants (Schmid 1994) with Penn TreeBank POS tagging )
- filtering out words too small or that occurred rarely in the corpus.
