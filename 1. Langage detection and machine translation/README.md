# Langage detection and machine translation
All journal articles and their metadata are organized into a Python dataframe. To identify the non-English articles, we used three automatic language-detection methods (language metadata when available in the downloaded documents, langid and langdetect packages) and extracted all documents for which non-English was detected at least once. Then, each non-English articles are sent to Google Translate by chunks of ~25000 characters (closest dot after 25000 characters). Translation results are then reassembled into articles.
